### Intro

Equipped with best engineering practices I gained through Makers software developer bootcamp, I am looking to join a collaborative and stimulating workplace where I can continue expanding my skillset. Teammates value my positive attitude, methodical approach and commitment to reusable, test-driven code.

### Makers bootcamp: software engineering training
- Fast-paced learning to fulfil project requirements to tight deadlines
- Working collaboratively on team projects (scoping user requirements, running sprints, stand-ups, retros and allocating tickets)
- Developing and applying best practices and principles within my work: Separation of concerns/SRP, TDD, MVC, DDD, Agile working
- Proactive and self-led learning to improve my skills and complete solo projects and challenges (e.g. Chitter, Bank)
- My adaptability and strong people skills mean I worked well in teams and pair programming, adapting my approach and communication style to suit a range of people
- Troubleshooting and debugging to support other developers when they encounter problems
- EQ training including feedback, empathy, which has proven invaluable during code reviews

### My background and career change motivations
Studying mathematics and spanish at University inspired my passion for solving problems collaboratively and methodically. Later, when working as an events manager, my creativity and can-do approach enabled me to solve problems and lead the delivery team onsite. Through Makers, I have learnt to my analytical mind and problem-solving skills when working independently or within a team to deliver a new app or program that meets user requirements.

In search of a new challenge, and the fulfilment that solving maths problems once gave me, I began coding last year. This led to the realisation that I did not need to be working in the Charity sector to make a positive impact on society. Becoming a software engineer quickly became a hugely exciting prospect – a career where I could apply my mathematical mind to solve real-world challenges, and one which would offer me endless learning opportunities.
